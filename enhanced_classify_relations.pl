# Saves the information that a particular edge is caused by a particular
# enhancement type. By default, we copy DEPS to MISC and extend the syntax so
# that the enhancement type can be stored next to the edge.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Known types:
# * basic (B) ... this enhanced edge is identical to an edge in the basic tree (including the deprel)
# * cased (C) ... case-enhanced relation (the relation with the shorter label may or may not exist in the basic tree)
# * relabeled (L) ... the same two nodes are also connected in the basic tree but the deprel is different and the difference does not look like a case enhancement
# * gapping (G) ... the parent or the child is an empty node; the edge was added because of gapping
# * orphan (O) ... basic relation missing from enhanced graph because it was replaced by a relation to/from an empty node (the basic edge is not necessarily labeled 'orphan')
# * coparent (P) ... shared parent of coordination, relation propagated to a non-first conjunct
# * codepend (S) ... shared dependent of coordination, relation propagated from a non-first conjunct
# * xsubj (X) ... relation between a controlled predicate and its external subject
# * relcl (R) ... relation between a node in a relative clause and the modified nominal; also the 'ref' relation between the modified nominal and the coreferential relative pronoun
# * relpron (W) ... basic relation incoming to a relative pronoun is missing from enhanced graph because it was replaced by the 'ref' relation
# * missing (M) ... basic relation is missing from the enhanced graph but none of the above reasons has been recognized
# * enhanced (E) ... this enhanced edge does not exist in the basic tree and none of the above reasons has been recognized
# Some types may be combined. For example, there may be an enhanced relation
# that exists because of 'relcl' and 'coparent', and it would disappear if
# either of the enhancement types were not annotated.
