    No predicate should have more than one subject.
    An xcomp dependent normally has no subject, but in some languages the
    requirement may be weaker: it could have an overt subject if it is
    correferential with a particular argument of the matrix verb. Hence we do
    not check zero subjects of xcomp dependents at present.
    Furthermore, in some situations we must allow multiple subjects. If a clause
    acts as a nonverbal predicate of another clause, then we must attach two
    subjects to the predicate of the inner clause: one is the predicate of the
    inner clause, the other is the predicate of the outer clause. This could in
    theory be recursive but in practice it isn't. As of UD 2.10, an amendment
    of the guidelines says that the inner predicate of the predicate clause
    should govern both subjects even if there is a copula (previously such
    cases were an exception from the UD approach that copulas should not be
    heads); however, the outer subjects should be attached as [nc]subj:outer.
    See https://universaldependencies.org/changes.html#multiple-subjects.
    See also issue 34 (https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/tools/issues/34).
    Strictly speaking, :outer is optional because it is a subtype, and some
    treebanks may want to avoid it. For example, in Coptic Scriptorium, there
    is only one occurrence in dev, one in test, and none in train, so it would
    be impossible to train a parser that gets it right. For that reason, it is
    possible to replace the :outer subtype with Subject=Outer in MISC. The MISC
    attribute is just a directive for the validator and no parser is expected
    to predict it.
