Conceptual differences between the active version of the Validator class and the proposed changes in udtools/validate.py

- Every check_...() function should return a list of incidents, possibly empty.
  - This would invert the current logic, where check_...() methods return bool, with True meaning "no incidents (errors)".
    With a list as return value, the function could still be used in a condition, but empty list = False would mean OK.
    (In Validator, we currently return the bool value only from functions whose OK is needed before other checks can be
    run. But we could easily extend the behavior to all checks.)
- When constructing Incident, the new proposal does not call its confirm() method as we do in Validator. Calling this
  method must be restored, otherwise it would not be possible to print incidents as soon as they are encountered (which
  is useful with very large treebanks).
- Long explanations of errors and possible remedies are omitted from incidents. I would put them back at least for now.
  If something is to happen with them, it can be a separate issue in the future.
- A logger is used for debugging purposes and every check_...() function prints a summary of checks performed and
  incidents encountered.

- A central engine runs the checks that the user specifies in a configuration file. Even the default (official) full
  validation would rely on a default configuration file.
  - I am not very enthusiastic about making it so flexible, although I agree that some customization of the checks to
    be run is desirable. I would prefer to keep the validation plan in the source code and to allow the user to turn
    off certain checks. The dependencies between checks (check B cannot be run if check A did not pass) should be also
    hardcoded rather than allowing the user to fiddle with them.
  - In any case, disabling individual checks (or restricting validation only to selected checks) would provide much
    more fine-grained control over the validation than the existing --level options (but those would be preserved, too).
  - This is in addition to the option already available in the current Validator, namely to run all the checks but print
    only selected incidents. (This is now possible if the Validator is set to the --quiet mode, incidents are collected,
    filtered and then printed. Therefore, it is not compatible with printing incidents as soon as they are encountered.)
- There seems to be a tendency to divide the check_...() functions so that each incident type (testid) has its own
  function. I don't think it is practical to do this systematically everywhere, although in some cases the division may
  improve code readability and manageability.
  - Nevertheless, if the user can customize the validator to print only selected incidents (but still immediately after
    encountering them), and if this can be customized separately from saying which checks should be run, then it does
    not matter that some check_...() functions can return incidents of different kinds.
  - Independently of the above, one may want to turn off warnings and keep only errors (this could be a third state to
    the --quiet vs. normal mode).
- Although not directly apparent from the current code in udtools/validate.py, I think that the idea is to also allow
  for custom checks on top of the official validator. While it is easy to derive a new class from Validator and define
  new check_...() methods in it, it is an open question how such extensions should be made available for the user
  through the command line interface. Ideally, they could be turned on and off the same way as the standard checks.
  But this can be left as a separate issue for the future.

- In the current implementation of udtools/validate.py, the check_...() functions are placed directly in the module,
  without the Validator class. However, I do not see reasons to abandon the class and I intend to keep it.
