- organize test cases so that they match `testid`s
  - add as a comment which tests should fail as a metadata
- try to have a 1:1 mapping between test functions (`validate_xxx`) and `testid`s/incidents, or at least modularize test functions further (e.g. `validate_tree` is conceptually composed of 3 tests)
